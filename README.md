**Zero Hour running natively on Android** — campaign, skirmish, Generals Challenge,
and full online multiplayer (GeneralsOnline: lobby, custom match, quickmatch,
persona/stats, friends & social), with touch controls built for RTS (tap-select,
drag-box, long-press deselect, two-finger pan, pinch/anchor zoom). No emulation:
this is the real 2003 engine compiled for ARM64, rendering DirectX 8 →
[DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk) → **Vulkan native** — no translation
layer beyond DXVK itself, since Android speaks Vulkan directly.

The same codebase also runs on Apple Silicon Macs, iPhone, and iPad (DirectX 8 →
DXVK → [MoltenVK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK) → Metal) — that's
where this port started, and it's still maintained, but active development has
shifted to Android, which is now the most complete and most heavily
real-device-tested target.

Built on EA's GPL v3 source release, standing on a chain of community work —
[TheSuperHackers](https://github.com/TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode),
[Fighter19's original Unix port](https://github.com/Fighter19/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour), and
[fbraz3/GeneralsX](https://github.com/fbraz3/GeneralsX) — this fork adds the
Android and iOS/iPadOS ports, GeneralsOnline multiplayer, and a set of engine
fixes. See [Lineage & credits](#lineage--credits) for who built what. The
original GeneralsX README lives on the `upstream-main` branch.

**No game assets are included or distributed.** You need your own copy
([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2732960/), ~$5 on sale).

## Status

- **Android**: primary target. CI builds a signed, installable APK on every
  push. Campaign, skirmish, and Generals Challenge run natively. **Online
  multiplayer works**: GeneralsOnline (a from-scratch NGMP-based backend, not
  the long-dead GameSpy servers) drives account login, the multiplayer lobby,
  Custom Match (create/browse/join, live room + player lists, chat), Quickmatch,
  My Persona (stats/rank), and Communicator (friends/social). This has been
  shaken out against real players and real devices, including bug reports from
  outside testers via this repo's [issue tracker](../../issues) — see
  [`docs/port/ANDROID_PORT.md`](docs/port/ANDROID_PORT.md) for the device/driver
  matrix and the full bring-up log.
- **macOS / iOS / iPadOS**: fully working (campaign, skirmish, Generals
  Challenge), maintained, not currently receiving the same volume of new work.
  GeneralsOnline multiplayer has not been ported to these platforms yet — the
  Android build is where that backend was built.

## What this port actually involved

"Porting" undersells how weird this journey was, so here's the honest shape of it.
The lineage below built the foundation: EA's source release, the community's
modernization, Fighter19's original Unix port, GeneralsX's macOS/Linux work.
None of that included a mobile online-multiplayer backend, or Android at all —
and both are hostile territory for a 2003 Windows RTS:

- **GameSpy is dead. The retail multiplayer stack assumes it isn't.** Zero
  Hour's entire online layer — matchmaking, lobbies, buddy lists, stats — was
  built on GameSpy SDK calls to servers EA shut down over a decade ago. Getting
  multiplayer working again meant building a real backend (GeneralsOnline,
  NGMP-based: REST + WebSocket, its own auth/session/lobby/stats/social
  services) and re-wiring the original `.wnd` UI screens and GUI callbacks —
  largely untouched since 2003 — to talk to it instead, one menu at a time
  (Welcome screen, Custom Match, Quickmatch, My Persona, Communicator).
- **Async callbacks + screen teardown is a loaded gun.** Almost every real
  crash chased down on real devices during multiplayer bring-up turned out to
  be the same shape: an HTTP or WebSocket completion callback captured a raw
  pointer (a `GameWindow*`, a roster entry, a listbox) that was still valid
  when the request was *sent*, but the user had already backed out of the
  screen — or a second refresh had already torn it down — by the time the
  response landed. The fix pattern that recurred: capture a stable ID, not a
  pointer, and re-resolve (or bail) inside the callback.
- **The engine assumes a writable filesystem wherever it lives, and a mouse.**
  Android's scoped storage and SDL3's raw touch events needed the same kind of
  rerouting and gesture-to-mouse translation work the iOS port pioneered — tap
  defers until the 2003 GUI processes hover, a drag becomes a selection box or
  a camera pan depending on how it started, one held finger + a second moving
  vertically is zoom (not classic two-finger pinch, which fought camera pan),
  and a double-tap now does what a PC double-click always did (select all of
  one unit type on screen).
- **Old data, new parser, sharp edges.** Zero Hour's `.ini` data layers on top
  of base Generals data, and the two games were split into separate build
  targets at some point in this codebase's history — with a couple of
  genuinely-still-used tokens (`DamageType=FLESHY_SNIPER`, `KindOf=AIRFIELD`)
  accidentally compiled out of the Zero Hour build in that split. Both looked
  like "someone's mod is doing something weird" until traced back to a
  preprocessor guard on the wrong side of an `#if`.
- **And a memory-corruption hunt that went all the way to the allocator.**
  Unresolved-crash-PC segfaults with no clean call stack, days apart, no
  obvious pattern — eventually traced to the engine's global `operator
  delete` override having no way to tell "one of ours" from a pointer a
  separately-linked `.so` (OpenAL, DXVK) allocated through its own copy of
  `new`. Fixed with an ownership cookie instead of blind trust.

Worth saying plainly: this was a **human + AI collaboration**. The engineering —
the C++, the cross-builds, the device debugging, the multiplayer backend — was
done by [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (Anthropic's Claude),
directed and playtested by a human who described symptoms like *"the lobby
list is empty"* and *"it crashes right after I press Back"* and owned every
decision. Neither half ships this alone: one of us can't write C++, and the
other can't play-test on a real phone.

## Quick start — Android

Same engine, one translation layer fewer than iOS: DirectX 8 → DXVK →
**Vulkan native** (no MoltenVK). Needs a device whose GPU driver speaks
**Vulkan 1.3** (Snapdragon with Adreno 7xx/8xx: yes; older Mali like the G76:
no — the app detects this and shows a clear on-screen message instead of
silently closing; see the doc for driver-replacement options).

**No local toolchain needed** — push to a `claude/**` branch (or run it
manually) and GitHub Actions builds the APK: **Actions tab → Build Android →
Run workflow**. Every CI build is signed with the same committed debug key and
gets an increasing versionCode, so you can install a newer run **over** an
older one without uninstalling. (On a fork, enable Actions once: Actions tab →
"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them".) Download the APK
artifact from the run and install it.

**No adb needed either, for setup or logs**: the APK installs a second icon,
**"GeneralsZH Setup"**, with an in-app folder picker (point it at wherever
you copied your own game files — Downloads, an SD card, anywhere) and a log
viewer with Clear/Share buttons. See [docs/port/ANDROID_PORT.md §4](docs/port/ANDROID_PORT.md#4-game-data-and-first-run--the-in-app-setup-flow-no-adb-no-pc-needed)
for the full first-run walkthrough.

Building locally instead needs the Android NDK (r26+), vcpkg, meson/ninja:

```sh
cd GeneralsX
git submodule update --init references/fbraz3-dxvk
export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=~/Android/Sdk/ndk/<version>
./scripts/build/android/build-android-zh.sh        # game -> libmain.so, DXVK -> .so, verified
./scripts/build/android/package-android-zh.sh --install
```

**→ The full guide (device/driver matrix, storage layout, multiplayer
architecture, bring-up log): [docs/port/ANDROID_PORT.md](docs/port/ANDROID_PORT.md)**

## Quick start — macOS

Prerequisites (one time):

```sh
# Toolchain
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake ninja meson pkgconf
brew install --cask steamcmd

# vcpkg (full clone — a shallow clone breaks manifest baselines)
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg ~/vcpkg && ~/vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export VCPKG_ROOT=~/vcpkg          # add to your shell profile

# LunarG Vulkan SDK (NOT the Homebrew cask) — https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home
export VULKAN_SDK=$HOME/VulkanSDK/<version>/macOS   # add to your shell profile
```

Clone, build, get assets, play:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ammaarreshi/Generals-Mac-iOS-iPad.git GeneralsX
cd GeneralsX
./scripts/build/macos/build-macos-zh.sh     # checks deps, configures, builds
./scripts/build/macos/deploy-macos-zh.sh    # creates ~/GeneralsX/GeneralsZH + run.sh
./scripts/get-assets.sh <your_steam_username>   # fetches game data you own
cd ~/GeneralsX/GeneralsZH && ./run.sh -win
```

## Quick start — iPhone / iPad

On top of the macOS prerequisites: full Xcode (signed into your Apple ID),
`brew install xcodegen`, and a (free or paid) Apple Developer team.

```sh
cd GeneralsX
git submodule update --init references/fbraz3-dxvk   # iOS DXVK is built from this + Patches/dxvk-ios.patch
./scripts/build/ios/fetch-moltenvk.sh                # pinned MoltenVK.framework (checksummed)
./scripts/build/ios/stage-fonts.sh                   # Liberation fonts, renamed as the game expects
cmake --preset ios-vulkan
cmake --build build/ios-vulkan --target z_generals
GX_TEAM_ID=<your-team-id> GX_BUNDLE_ID=com.you.generalszh \
    ./scripts/build/ios/package-ios-zh.sh --install  # assembles, signs, installs
```

Find your team id in Xcode → Settings → Accounts. Assets ship inside the app
bundle (self-contained install); `--dev` skips the ~2.7 GB copy for fast code
iteration.

## Known issues

- Long sessions on iPad can be killed by iOS for memory (~3 GB+ resident); the app
  exits to the home screen with no dialog. Session logs (current + previous) are in
  the Files app under the game's folder. Under investigation.
- Backgrounding mid-game can occasionally crash on iOS — the lifecycle pause covers
  the common paths; a rare race remains. Save often.
- Android: GPUs limited to Vulkan 1.1 (e.g. Mali-G76) can't run the DXVK 2.6 path —
  the app now shows a clear on-screen message instead of closing silently; see
  [docs/port/ANDROID_PORT.md §2](docs/port/ANDROID_PORT.md#2-the-device--driver-matrix-read-this-before-filing-black-screen-bugs)
  for driver-replacement options if you want to chase it further.
- Android multiplayer is under active real-device shakeout — most reported crashes
  have traced to a handful of recurring bug classes (see the "what this port
  actually involved" section above) and get fixed fast, but if something's still
  rough, check or file an issue.

## What's next: Renegade 👀

Generals had a chain of giants to stand on. **Command & Conquer: Renegade** — EA's
2002 FPS from the same GPL source release — has far less: no native macOS or iOS
build of the W3D engine has ever shipped (Mac players today go through Wine-based
compatibility layers). The [OpenW3D](https://github.com/w3dhub/OpenW3D) community
project has real cross-platform groundwork — a DXVK wrapper scaffold and SDL3 build
plumbing — with Mac/Linux on its roadmap, and that groundwork is exactly what we
built on.

Same methodology as this repo, much deeper water: OpenW3D's Win32 compat scaffold
expanded by ~3,000 lines (the engine calls raw Windows APIs for file finding,
keyboard state, COM), a case-sensitivity strategy for twenty thousand asset paths,
the DXVK/MoltenVK renderer bring-up, the audio/video stack, and FPS touch controls.
It's playable today — campaign, cinematics, mission scripts — on a Mac and an
iPhone. For scale: this Generals port added ~2,200 lines on top of GeneralsX;
Renegade needed ~6,700 on top of the Windows-only source.

Repo drops soon, with the OpenW3D lineage credited the way this repo credits its
chain. Same rules: GPL v3, bring your own copy, full engineering log.

## Lineage & credits

This port is the newest link in a long chain, and the earlier links did foundational
work that this repo inherits everywhere:

- **Westwood / EA Pacific** — the game; **EA** — the GPL v3 source release
- **[TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode](https://github.com/TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode)** —
  the community mainline: build modernization, VC6→modern toolchain, and much of the
  cross-platform groundwork, including the FFmpeg video backend authored by
  **[feliwir](https://github.com/feliwir)** (of [OpenSAGE](https://github.com/OpenSAGE/OpenSAGE)),
  who also authored the OpenAL audio device work this port's audio stack builds on
- **[Fighter19/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour](https://github.com/Fighter19/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour)** —
  the original Unix/64-bit port: SDL3 platform management, C++17
  filesystem/threading, Freetype/Fontconfig text rendering, and the DXVK approach
  this renderer path descends from
- **[fbraz3/GeneralsX](https://github.com/fbraz3/GeneralsX)** — the macOS/Linux port
  this fork builds on directly, integrating and extending the above
- **[tarek369/GeneralsZH-Android](https://github.com/tarek369/GeneralsZH-Android)** —
  an independent, parallel Android port of the same lineage; several real bugs in
  this port (a duplicate-symbol build break, an INI-parsing gap) were cross-checked
  and traced faster thanks to its published engineering log
- **This fork** — the Android port (GeneralsOnline multiplayer backend, touch
  controls, in-app Setup/log-viewer flow, device bring-up) and the iOS/iPadOS
  port (arm64-ios cross-build, DXVK-on-iOS, touch controls, app lifecycle,
  packaging), plus engine fixes throughout, offered upstream
- **DXVK, MoltenVK, SDL, OpenAL Soft, FFmpeg, Liberation Fonts** — the load-bearing walls

Engine code **GPL v3** (EA's source release → the chain above → this fork). Game
assets: not included, not licensed here.
