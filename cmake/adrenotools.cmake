# GeneralsX @feature Android port 10/07/2026 libadrenotools
# (https://github.com/bylaws/libadrenotools, BSD-2-Clause) lets the app load
# a user-supplied Vulkan driver -- most commonly a Mesa Turnip build for
# Adreno GPUs -- in place of the phone's stock vendor driver. It works by
# installing a linker-namespace-bypass hook that transparently redirects
# every later dlopen("libvulkan.so") call in the process, so DXVK's own
# internal loader (references/fbraz3-dxvk/src/vulkan/vulkan_loader.cpp)
# picks up the custom driver without ever being patched or made aware of
# this -- see TryLoadCustomVulkanDriver() in SDL3Main.cpp, which must run
# before SDL_Vulkan_LoadLibrary() so the hook is installed first.
#
# This is Adreno-only: Turnip has no Mali backend, so it cannot help phones
# whose GPU is Mali (e.g. the Mali-G76 case documented in SDL3Main.cpp).
# What it DOES help: Adreno phones whose stock driver reports Vulkan 1.1/1.2
# while DXVK 2.6 needs 1.3 -- exactly the ceiling AndroidManifest.xml's
# uses-feature currently documents.
#
# Nothing here is used unless a user actually imports a driver via the Setup
# app's "Custom Vulkan Driver" section (SetupActivity.java) -- by default
# custom_driver.cfg doesn't exist and TryLoadCustomVulkanDriver() is a no-op.
